# Goblin Cannon simulated channel report

<!-- BEGIN CHANNEL CONTRACT -->

For the recorded acceptance profile:

The modem assumes the radio hands it audio with the carrier frequency offset already removed to within 10 Hz. It performs no Doppler-shift correction. Delay spread, Doppler spread, fading, phase rotation, multipath and noise are the modem's problem, and are what the recorded runs measure.

This boundary describes the recorded acceptance profile. The carrier-offset sweep uses 24 kHz QPSK+BCH, the combined recovery settings, the high-latitude quiet preset, 30 dB nominal SNR and three 300-second traces per offset. The tolerance applies to that measured configuration and the tested offset grid. Other modes and historical receiver versions have no tolerance established by this sweep. The library retains an optional carrier-correction loop, enabled by default; the recorded acceptance profile explicitly disables it. Equalizer phase tracking does not estimate a mean carrier frequency offset or perform AFC.

All results use simulated channels. No transmission or RF equipment measurement is represented.

### Simulated channel B5 measured host loopback

Wall-clock source creation to sink delivery, paced with simulated audio blocks. These non-canonical observations include OS scheduling and CPU work; no physical audio device is represented.

2.1 ms applies to added processing/buffering. The intrinsic reference replays the actual selected messages at their original creation times, through the production stack with one-sample blocks. Values are paired by message identity before computing percentiles.

#### Simulated channel B5 stage call durations

TX and RX include their framing/FEC/crypto work. Per-call durations do not add up to per-message latency; queue residence is included in end-to-end measurements.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### Simulated channel B5 transmission and modem residence

Analytical estimates explain the intrinsic reference; they are not used to subtract latency or gate the allowance. Message serialization includes coding and mean pilot duty. Byte/symbol alignment, actual pilot positions and startup remain in the separately reported reference.

## Simulated channel — Open thresholds

| ID | Status | Proposed value / approach | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A4.ber_delta | THRESHOLD_TBD | 0 absolute excess BER in the noise-free regression; select a confidence interval for noisy runs | No radio residual-offset budget or BER margin is specified. |
| C2.acquisition_seconds | THRESHOLD_TBD | one complete preamble/training/header plus one audio block | The configured startup lengths give a measurable lower bound; approval needed. |
| C3.recovery_frames | THRESHOLD_TBD | 2 frames after a new valid epoch preamble | The current stream needs an epoch preamble to reacquire; a deadline without one is undefined. |
| C4.pattern_ber_margin | THRESHOLD_TBD | a paired confidence interval, with its significance level selected by Adam | Equal finite-sample BER is not a statistical scrambler test. |
| D1.newest_latency_ms | THRESHOLD_TBD | one frame duration + 2.1 ms, as proposed in the brief | Needs agreement on whether serialization, FEC lookahead and startup are included. |
| D2.freshness_agreement_ms | THRESHOLD_TBD | compare paired freshness distributions; select a quantile margin | Equal survival fractions do not imply equal burst structure. |
| D2.target_survival_margin | THRESHOLD_TBD | select a confidence interval for channel calibration; direct erasures round to the nearest whole frame | A finite SNR grid cannot guarantee exactly 30%, 50%, or 80% channel survival. |
| D3.instrument_delay_ms | THRESHOLD_TBD | one frame duration + 2.1 ms | Strict bid priority and starvation freedom can conflict under sustained overload. |
| D6.rotation_loss_frames | THRESHOLD_TBD | one epoch startup plus the in-flight frame | There is no coordinated rotation protocol to measure yet. |
| E3.memory_growth_bytes | THRESHOLD_TBD | zero steady growth after warmup; choose an allocator/RSS allowance | Host RSS varies and includes harness allocations. |
| E3.queue_depth | THRESHOLD_TBD | configured ring capacity plus one pending auction bid | Must distinguish queue capacity from newest-message freshness. |
| E3.latency_change | THRESHOLD_TBD | a paired percentile tolerance chosen from baseline variability | Exact equality across different fading realizations is not a usable acceptance rule. |

## Simulated channel coverage and limitations

- These follow-up tests include Adam-authorized fixes to clock/gain/equalizer tracking, transmit buffering, auction freshness and receiver sequencing/gaps. Each record identifies its tested source snapshot; earlier audit records remain historical.
- Carrier correction is disabled. The adaptive equalizer includes a first-order common phase coefficient; it has no frequency estimate or frequency accumulator. Clock recovery adjusts sample instants only.
- 24 kHz use of the F.1487 model is an extrapolation beyond that recommendation's approximately 12 kHz scope.
- A1 uses declared 10-second screening traces. The requested grids and long 600-second quick cases are not reduced to meet a runtime budget.
- BER excludes erased/unobserved bits: inspect bit observation fraction and frame survival alongside it. No acquisition is never reported as zero BER.
- Symbol-probe goodput counts correct RF-frame bits; message-probe goodput counts application bytes. They are labeled separately in JSON.
- Total source-to-sink latency includes startup and audio buffering. B5 applies 2.1 ms to per-message added processing/buffering above a matched one-sample intrinsic reference. Its separate paced host observations include CPU/OS scheduling. Transmission and modem residence estimates are also reported. Physical audio devices and network sockets are outside this simulated loopback.
- Usable-time is an explicitly labeled local one-second delivery-window proxy. Exact STAC comparability is unavailable pending audit definitions/standby instrumentation.
- Conditional unsupported features, missing recordings, unrun soak cases, and open thresholds are never counted as passes.
- D6 cannot count AEAD authentication failures at A1 error rates because production exposes AES-CTR/CRC only. Its replay check exercises captured framed messages at the deframer; it does not claim an encrypted RF replay audit with wall-clock timestamp validation.
- D1 includes both isolated auction service and a null-channel auction-to-radio-to-sink overload fixture at 10 kHz/QPSK/rate-1/2. D3 isolates auction service. Per-key newest-message and chronological-window latency observations are retained; unapproved delay margins remain open.

## Simulated channel runtime observations

| Tier / selection | Executed / selected cases | Seconds | Budget seconds | Within budget |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| full / selected rerun | 3 / 3 | 2.084 | 1800 | yes |
Execution wall time is a non-canonical host observation. An overrun preserves all durations, sample counts and grid points; a selected rerun is not a replacement tier timing.
